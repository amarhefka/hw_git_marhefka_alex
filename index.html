				<h2>Their Eyes</h2>

				<p>One of the coolest things about mantis shrimp is their vision. As humans, we have three color-receptive cones in our eyes; they're mapped, more or less, to the wavelengths of the primary colors red, green, and blue. The mantis shrimp, by comparison, has <em>sixteen</em> color-receptive cones in its eyes, which allows it to see colors with more variety and vividity than we could ever imagine.</p>
