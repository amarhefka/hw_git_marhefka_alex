				<h2>Their Eyes</h2>

				<p>One of the most impressive things about mantis shrimp is their vision. As humans, we have three color-receptive cones in our eyes; they're mapped, more or less, to the wavelengths of the primary colors red, green, and blue. The mantis shrimp, by comparison, has <em>sixteen</em> color-receptive cones in its eyes, which allows it to see colors with more variety and vividity than we could ever imagine.</p>

				<h2>Their Claws</h2>

				<p>The mantis shrimp has such insanely powerful claws that, when they strike, the water in their path becomes a shockwave of vapor-filled <em>cavitation</em> bubbles that can actually stun or kill their prey if the claw itself misses. There are varieties of mantis shrimp with different kinds of claws, generally categorizable into either <em>smashers</em> or <em>spearers</em>, and all of them are capable of this cavitation effect.</p>

				<h2>Their Behavior</h2>

				<p>The mantis shrimp is a colorful, terrifying, occasionally monogamous crustacean with nothing to lose. They are highly territorial, and when kept in captivity they are notorious for killing and eating their neighbors. They are also known for shattering the glass of aquariums, and one of their non-scientific nicknames is <em>the prawn killer</em>. Do not befriend them lightly.</p>
