## Resources
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp)
	* I used the Mantis Shrimp Wikipedia page as my primary source of information and images as I drafted the content for this site.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
	* I referenced W3Schools to double-check that I was using CSS properties appropriatelyâ€”the properties I didn't have memorized, that is, namely the gradient, box-shadow, and text-shadow.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus.

## Comments
I hope you'll bear with me as I get the hang of Git. A few of my commit messages were a little sloppy in that they either (a) contained multiple discrete changes, which I separated with semicolons, or (b) I forgot to use an initial capital letter. In the future, I'll strive to give each commit a singular purpose, and I'll eventually get the hang of the editorial standards too.
